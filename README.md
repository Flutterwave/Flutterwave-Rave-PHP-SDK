# Rave PHP SDK :wink:

Use this library to integrate your PHP app to Rave.

Simply edit the `paymentForm.php` and `processPayment.php` files to suit your purpose. Both files are well documented.
The vendor folder is committed into the project to allow easy installation for those who do not have composer installed.
It is recommended to update the project dependencies using;

```shell

$ composer install

```

You can also find the class documentation in the docs folder. There you will find documentation for the `Rave` class and the `EventHandlerInterface`.

Enjoy... :v:

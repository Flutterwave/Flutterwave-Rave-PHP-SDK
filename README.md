# Rave PHP SDK :wink:

> Class documentation can be found here [https://flutterwave.github.io/Flutterwave-Rave-PHP-SDK/packages/Default.html](https://flutterwave.github.io/Flutterwave-Rave-PHP-SDK/packages/Default.html)

Use this library to integrate your PHP app to Rave.

Edit the `paymentForm.php` and `processPayment.php` files to suit your purpose. Both files are well documented.

Simply redirect to the `paymentForm.php` file on your browser to process a payment.

The vendor folder is committed into the project to allow easy installation for those who do not have composer installed.
It is recommended to update the project dependencies using;

```shell
$ composer install
```

## Sample implementation

In this implementation, we are expecting a form encoded POST request to this script.
The request will contain the following parameters.

- payment_method `Can be card, account, both`
- description `Your transaction description`
- logo `Your logo url`
- title `Your transaction title`
- country `Your transaction country`
- currency `Your transaction currency`
- email `Your customer's email`
- firstname `Your customer's firstname`
- lastname `Your customer's lastname`
- phonenumber `Your customer's phonenumber`
- pay_button_text `The payment button text you prefer`
- ref `Your transaction reference. It must be unique per transaction.  By default, the Rave class generates a unique transaction reference for each transaction. Pass this parameter only if you uncommented the related section in the script below.`

```php
// Prevent direct access to this class
define("BASEPATH", 1);

### Sample implementation using a php function to fund a rave account

In this implementation, all the functionality has been pre-written in the PHP SDK. All you have 
to do is pass a function which calls the PHP SDK that is needed.

```php
    require_once('Flutterwave/api/Pay.php');
    use Flutterwave\Pay;

	//fund wallet
	public function fundWallet($newamount)
	{
		$customer_email = "temi.adesina@gmail.com";//gets user email from db...but for the sake of this test....we are using my email
		$amount = $newamount;  
		$currency = "NGN";
		$txref = "rave-".time(); // ensure you generate unique references per transaction.
		$secretKey = "****YOUR**SECRET**KEY****";
		$env = "staging";
		$PBFPubKey = "****YOUR**PUBLIC**KEY****"; // we are suppose to pull from a table in our db name eg: "api-key". dont paste ur keys like this. but for the sake of this test, we will be doing the paste. 
		$redirect_url = "";//enter a redirect url
		$payment_plan = ""; // this is only required for recurring payments.

		$array_options = array(
            'amount'=>$amount,
            'customer_email'=>$customer_email,
            'currency'=>$currency,
            'txref'=>$txref,
            'PBFPubKey'=>$PBFPubKey,
            'redirect_url'=>$redirect_url,
            'payment_plan'=>$payment_plan
		);
        //calls the Pay SDK and initiates a payment 
        $pay = new Pay();
        //a result is returned from the pay call and this result is stored in a function
        $result = $pay->pay($PBFPubKey, $secretKey,$env,$array_options); 
        
        //decodes the result from the API into a json format
		$transaction = json_decode($result);

		if(!$transaction->data && !$transaction->data->link){
			// there was an error from the API
			print_r('API returned error: ' . $transaction->message);
		}
		
		// uncomment out this line if you want to redirect the user to the payment page
		//print_r($transaction->data->message);
		
		
		// redirect to page so User can pay
		// uncomment this line to allow the user redirect to the payment page
		header('Location: ' . $transaction->data->link);
	}

```

You can also find the class documentation in the docs folder. There you will find documentation for the `Rave` class and the `EventHandlerInterface`.

Enjoy... :v:

## ToDo

- Write Unit Test
- Support Tokenized payment

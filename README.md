# Rave PHP SDK :wink:

> Class documentation can be found here [https://iolufemi.github.io/Flutterwave-Rave-PHP-SDK/packages/Default.html](https://iolufemi.github.io/Flutterwave-Rave-PHP-SDK/packages/Default.html)

Use this library to integrate your PHP app to Rave.

Edit the `paymentForm.php` and `processPayment.php` files to suit your purpose. Both files are well documented.

Simply redirect to the `paymentForm.php` file on your browser to process a payment.

The vendor folder is committed into the project to allow easy installation for those who do not have composer installed.
It is recommended to update the project dependencies using;

```shell

$ composer install

```

You can also find the class documentation in the docs folder. There you will find documentation for the `Rave` class and the `EventHandlerInterface`.

Enjoy... :v:
